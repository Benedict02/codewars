# Codewars

This is a repository where I push my rank in codewars.

Personal commitment:

1. Exams = Minimum 2 kata per day. Normal = Minimum 3 kata per day.
2. Focus on learning the fundementals of python & algorithms.
3. Apply for OSN Informatics in the future(hopefully).

NOTE: During repository creation, it was late at night & I am != permitted to stay up late so I did not complete any kata.
